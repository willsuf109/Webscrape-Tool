# Webscrape-Tool

I enjoy watching basketball and making small bets on it. But it can be a time consuming process to look at all the sites to look at the odds at multiple different sites. I want to write a program that allows me to see the odds for all the major sites, without having to individually go into them. Ideally it shows the odds but also provides links to each of the sites for easy access.
